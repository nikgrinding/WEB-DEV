## What I'm Learning

-   **Core React Concepts:**

    -   Building dynamic user interfaces with reusable **Components** and managing data flow with **Props**.
    -   Managing component state with the `useState` Hook and handling user interactions with event handlers.
    -   Leveraging essential Hooks like `useEffect` and `useRef` to manage side effects, component lifecycle, and direct DOM manipulation.

-   **Application Architecture & Navigation:**

    -   Implementing client-side routing with **React Router** to build single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views.
    -   Structuring a scalable React application by organizing code into components, pages, and utility modules.

-   **Backend & Data Management:**

    -   Fetching and mutating data from a backend API using `axios` and modern `async/await` syntax.
    -   "Lifting state up" as a pattern for managing shared data across different parts of the application.

-   **Modern Development & Tooling:**

    -   Integrating **TypeScript** to add static typing for more robust, scalable, and maintainable code.
    -   Writing unit and integration tests using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure code quality and reliability.
    -   Understanding the new **React Compiler** (React 19) for automatic performance optimizations.
    -   Setting up a modern development environment with **Vite**.

-   **Deployment:**
    -   Deploying a full-stack React application to the cloud using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, including domain name and SSL configuration.
