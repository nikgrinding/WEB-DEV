# Web Development

Welcome to my Web Development repository! This is where I learn and experiment with different web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks/libraries.

## Status

I'm currently in the early learning phase. Expect to find:

- Small practice projects  
- Code snippets  
- Notes and experiments  

| Technology   | Progress        |
|--------------|-----------------|
| HTML         | âœ… Completed   |
| CSS          | âœ… Completed   |
| JavaScript   | ðŸ”„ In Progress   |
| Flask   | ðŸ”„ In Progress   |

## Repository Structure

I'm organizing this repo into directories based on technologies and topics to keep things neat and scalable:

```bash
/html-css    # Experiments using HTML and CSS
/javascript  # JavaScript learning and snippets
/...         # Additional folders for frameworks/libraries in the future
```

## Notes

**This is mainly a personal learning space for now, but feel free to check it out or leave feedback!**
