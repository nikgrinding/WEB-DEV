# Web Development

Welcome to my Web Development repository! This is where I learn and experiment with different web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks/libraries.

## Status

Currently I am in the early learning phase. Expect a mix of small projects, notes, and code snippets as I build my web dev skills. 

This repo currently includes:

| Tech        | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| HTML        | 🔄     |
| CSS         | 🔄     |
| JavaScript  | ❌     |

## Notes

**This is mainly a personal learning space for now, but feel free to check it out or leave feedback!**
