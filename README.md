# Web Development

Welcome to my Web Development repository! This is where I learn and experiment with different web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks/libraries.

## Status

I'm currently in the early learning phase. Expect to find:

-   Small practice projects
-   Code snippets
-   Notes and experiments

| Technology | Progress           |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| HTML       | ✅ Completed       |
| CSS        | ✅ Completed       |
| JavaScript | ✅ Completed       |
| Flask      | ✅ Completed       |
| React      | 🔄 In Progress     |
| Bootstrap  | ✅ Basic Knowledge |

## Repository Structure

I'm organizing this repo into directories based on technologies and topics to keep things neat and scalable:

```bash
/html-css    # Experiments using HTML and CSS
/javascript  # JavaScript learning and snippets
/...         # Additional folders for frameworks/libraries in the future
```

## Notes

**This is mainly a personal learning space for now, but feel free to check it out or leave feedback!**
